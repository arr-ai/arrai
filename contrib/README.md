# contrib

Contrib scripts are not officially part of arr.ai, and receive no official
support. However they provide functionality that may be broadly useful, and
examples of how to use different features of arr.ai. As such, they are bundled
into the arr.ai repository for easy access and reference.

If other common patterns emerge, this directory will serve as a logical place
for them to live.
