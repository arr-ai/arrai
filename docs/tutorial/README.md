# Arr.ai tutorial

This tutorial will take you step by step through the arr.ai language. It will be
light on theory, focusing more on learning by doing. If you want a more
theoretical introduction to the features of the language, [Introduction to
Arr.ai](../README.md) is a good place to start.

The following chapters start with the basics of the language, and develop
steadily towards the more advanced features.

To follow along, use arr.ai's interactive shell, which may be started with:

```bash
$ arrai i
@> _
```

or, if an appropriate symlink is set up (see the main [README](../../README.md)
for instructions):

```bash
$ ai
@> _
```

Once you see the `@>` prompt, you can try the code examples in the following
chapters.

## Arr.ai command line

commands to run programs, start an arr.ai server or client, etc.

1. (TODO) run, r: evaluate an arrai file
2. (TODO) eval, e: evaluate an arrai expression
3. (TODO) observe, o: observe an expression on a server
4. (TODO) serve, s: start arrai as a gRPC server
5. (TODO) sync, s: sync local files to a server
6. (TODO) transform, x: transform a stream of input data with an expression
7. (TODO) update, u: update a server with an expression
